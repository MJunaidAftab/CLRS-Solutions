# CLRS-Solutions

This repository contains some of my solutions to problems and exercises in the textbook Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest and Stein. I have used Jupyter Notebooks to implement the algorithms and data structures in Python. 

As I continue working through the textbook at my own pace, I expected to add updated Python notebooks for the correspionding sections and/or chapters accordingly. Occassionally, I may also update update the exisiting Python files if I rework a particular section and/or chapter and solve additional problems, optimzie code for a particular problem etc.
