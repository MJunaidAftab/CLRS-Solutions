# CLRS-Solutions

This repository contains files containing both code implementating some algorithms and data structures and solutions to  some problems and exercises in the textbook Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest and Stein. I have used Jupyter Notebooks to implement the algorithms and data structures in Python. Therefore, I have uploaded the Jupyter notebooks in the .pynb format. Some Python souce files in the .py format have been uploaded; others are available on request.

As I continue working through the textbook at my own pace, I expected to add updated Python notebooks for the correspionding sections and/or chapters accordingly. Occassionally, I may also update update the exisiting Python files if I rework a particular section and/or chapter and solve additional problems, optimzie code for a particular problem etc.
